dotfiles
========

everybody has one, these are mine

Main setup (OSX or Linux): bash + tmux + vim + vscode + mosh + i3

(also has some fish config support)

Installation is managed with GNU stow.

After installing stow with your packagemanager of choice then install individual
packages with

`stow vim`

etc
